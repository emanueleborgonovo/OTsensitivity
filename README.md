Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis with Optimal Transport 

This is a collection of Matlab subroutines accompanying the work: "Probabilistic Sensitivity via Optimal Transport", by E. Borgonovo, A. Figalli, E. Plischke and G. Savar√®, 2023, work in progress.

The file "ReproduceFiguresandTables.m" serves as main file of the experiments. It is divided into parts that guide the user towards the files used to create the figures and tables in the paper.
We also added both the pdf and the original MathCad file with the calculations needed to obtain the analytical values of the global sensitivity measures in Example 2, Section 3.2.
